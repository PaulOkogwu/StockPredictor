# StockPredictor
Analyzing Historical Data of the S&amp;P 500 Index using Python

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock market trends using a machine learning model based on historical S&P 500 data. The primary goal was to predict whether the stock market would close higher or lower on the next day, compared to the current day's close.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   Ensure that Python and pip are installed on your system. Then install the required packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook in your browser:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the notebook**:
   Navigate to the "Paul's Stock Predictor.ipynb" file in the Jupyter Notebook interface and open it.

5. **Run the notebook**:
   Execute the cells in the notebook to run the stock predictor model.

## Results
The model achieved a precision score of approximately 47.06% on the testing dataset. This score indicates the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.

## Learnings
While the precision achieved might not be very high, this project was instrumental in understanding the challenges involved in predicting stock market movements, which are influenced by a myriad of factors beyond historical price and volume. The importance of feature engineering, model selection, and parameter tuning was emphasized.

## Future Work
Improvements could involve:
- Examine indices from markets that open before the U.S. to see if they influence the S&P 500.
- Including more granular data such as minute-by-minute prices.
- Incorporating external data sources like economic indicators or news sentiment.
- Experimenting with different machine learning models and advanced techniques like deep learning or ensemble methods.
